    description: 'This is the classic Italian way to open a meal: the Negroni, a bittersweet palate cleanser that makes way for the evening’s delights. Adding a bottle of Campari to the liquor cabinet opens up a world of cocktail possibilities. In any case, drink this cold. This version came to us from Jim Meehan, a bartender and an owner of Please Dont Tell, a speakeasy in the East Village.',

This martini recipe is proof that sometimes the simplest things are actually the hardest to master. It might only need three ingredients—gin, vermouth, and a lemon twist—but fewer variables means that each one is very important to the final result. Technique is everything here.',
