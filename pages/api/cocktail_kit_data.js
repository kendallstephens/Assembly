    price: 60,
    ingredients: 'Gin, Campari, Sweet Vermouth' ,
    description: 'This is the classic Italian way to open a meal: the Negroni, a bittersweet palate cleanser that makes way for the evening’s delights. Adding a bottle of Campari to the liquor cabinet opens up a world of cocktail possibilities. In any case, drink this cold. This version came to us from Jim Meehan, a bartender and an owner of Please Dont Tell, a speakeasy in the East Village.',

        description: 'Even if you’re thinking to yourself, but I already know how to make a martini, you may want to keep reading anyway. This martini recipe is proof that sometimes the simplest things are actually the hardest to master. It might only need three ingredients—gin, vermouth, and a lemon twist—but fewer variables means that each one is very important to the final result. Technique is everything here.',

        ingredients: 'Rye, Amaro Montenegro, Egg White' ,
        description: 'Traditionally, orgeat is almond syrup, but Joseph Stinchcomb, beverage director at Saint Leo in Oxford, MS, has made it with everything from walnuts to pistachios. “It gives a beautiful toasted nut flavor to a cocktail,” he says. “Here I used pecans because they remind me of the family pecan tree at my grandparents’ house in Fayetteville, GA. Roasted pecans. Warm baking spices. Citrusy, caramelly Amaro Montenegro. A bit of spicy rye whiskey. They all work well together to create a cocktail that feels toasty. That’s what I love in a winter drink.” A second shake with an egg white creates a velvety texture and foamy top.',

        name: 'Mai Tai',

        ingredients: 'Rum,  Orgeat Syrup, Lime' ,
        description: 'There are raging debates about the invention of and the proper recipe for this drink among tiki connoisseurs. The more accepted versions are granted to Victor J. Bergeron, the irascible, wooden-legged “Trader Vic,” from his eponymous restaurant bar in Oakland, Calif., in the ’40s. Contrary to what you might think, the mai tai is actually just a rum sour, employing orgeat alongside Curaçao or triple sec as the sweetener, and using two rums to add complexity. The rest is just lime juice, and that’s it. No coconut, no passion fruit, pineapple, mango or orange juice. No umbrellas. It’s a relatively simple drink, but as such, each element has to be of the utmost quality; great rums, fresh lime juice and prefab orgeat syrup equal disappointment. But when concocted with homemade orgeat, all the tumblers click. The rums, the lime, the orange aromatics and the heft of the almond all play in stupendous balance.',
