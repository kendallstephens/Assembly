    ingredients: 'Gin, Campari, Sweet Vermouth' ,
    description: 'This is the classic Italian way to open a meal: the Negroni, a bittersweet palate cleanser that makes way for the evening’s delights. Adding a bottle of Campari to the liquor cabinet opens up a world of cocktail possibilities. In any case, drink this cold. This version came to us from Jim Meehan, a bartender and an owner of Please Dont Tell, a speakeasy in the East Village.',

        description: 'Even if you’re thinking to yourself, but I already know how to make a martini, you may want to keep reading anyway. This martini recipe is proof that sometimes the simplest things are actually the hardest to master. It might only need three ingredients—gin, vermouth, and a lemon twist—but fewer variables means that each one is very important to the final result. Technique is everything here.',

        description: 'Traditionally, orgeat is almond syrup, but Joseph Stinchcomb, beverage director at Saint Leo in Oxford, MS, has made it with everything from walnuts to pistachios. “It gives a beautiful toasted nut flavor to a cocktail,” he says. “Here I used pecans because they remind me of the family pecan tree at my grandparents’ house in Fayetteville, GA. Roasted pecans. Warm baking spices. Citrusy, caramelly Amaro Montenegro. A bit of spicy rye whiskey. They all work well together to create a cocktail that feels toasty. That’s what I love in a winter drink.” A second shake with an egg white creates a velvety texture and foamy top.',
